# GeoERA GIP-P issue handling procedure

Members of the GIP-P WP8 support team should, if possible, have GitHub accounts and watch the support issues page by going to  https://github.com/GeoEra-GIP/Project-Support-WP8 and selecting `Watch` from the drop down menu near the top of the page.

When a new issue is created:

- Edit the issue to remove email addresses and any other sensitive information. This is more likely to appear in issues created by sending emails to the support at geoera.eu address. Some text used informally in emails such as @anameofsomeone can accidentally result in other GitHub users getting unwanted notifications if that name corresponds to their username so these should also be edited.
- Once edited delete the original version from the issue history
- If the issue was created by being sent to the support email address rather than directly created in GitHub by someone with a GitHub user account then they should be emailed by a member of the support team with a note of the URL where the issue has been created telling them that responses will be posted there and also letting them know how they can sign up to GitHub so that they can get automatic notifications of updates.
- Either respond to the issue directly by commenting on it or attempt to identify which member of the GIP-P project would be best suited to answering it. If they have a GitHub account then assign the issue to them, otherwise email them with the URL asking them to respond.
