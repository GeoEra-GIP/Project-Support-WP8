## Objectives

We aim to empower the GeoERA Science Projects to disseminate and integrate data, information, interpretations and models resulting from their activities in a standards-based and interoperable manner through the GIP.

To do this we will be providing a suite of support tools, channels and activities to facilitate data sharing through the GIP including the generation of 
- Cookbooks 
- Provision of buddy systems
- Mentoring networks
- Creation of eLearning resources
- Delivery of training workshops.

## Support

Cookbook documentation will published to https://geoera-gip.github.io/documentation/

Direct support is initally to be offered via email helpdesk or raising issues via the [WP8 Issue Tracker](https://github.com/GeoEra-GIP/WP8-Support/issues). If issues are raised multiple times we will pin these on the issues page to form an FAQ.

Emails to support@geoera.eu will create issue in the issue tracker via bot with email geoerasupport@fire.fundersclub.com
