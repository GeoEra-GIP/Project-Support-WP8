## Objectives

To empower the GSPs to disseminate and integrate data, information, interpretations and models resulting from their activities in a standards-based and interoperable manner through the GIP.

To provide a suite of support tools, channels and activities to facilitate data sharing through the GIP including the generation of cookbooks, provision of buddy systems and mentoring networks, creation of eLearning resources and delivery of training workshops.

To build on data provider support provided in previous data sharing and interoperability projects such as OneGeology and EGDI by extending with new, novel support functions.
