## Objectives

We aim to empower the GeoERA Science Projects to disseminate and integrate data, information, interpretations and models resulting from their activities in a standards-based and interoperable manner through the GIP.

To do this we will be providing a suite of support tools, channels and activities to facilitate data sharing through the GIP including the generation of 
- Cookbooks 
- Provision of buddy systems
- Mentoring networks
- Creation of eLearning resources
- Delivery of training workshops.
