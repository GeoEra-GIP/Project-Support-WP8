# Containerisation

## Task 8.4. Containerisation. (NERC, BRGM, NGU).

DevOps methodologies and technologies such as containerisation are designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

Utilising this technology will enable the provision of an off-the-shelf starter kit for providing data to the GIP. This will give data providers a quick start in implementing the guidance encapsulated within the cookbooks.

This work will be carried out during the Full Development phase with finalisation being carried out in the Wrap-up phase.

## Deliverables

D8.4 Series of example Docker containers supporting the delivery of data via the GIP [month 32]
