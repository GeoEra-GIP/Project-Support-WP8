# Support
 
## Task 8.3. Create of a suite of data provider support systems. (NERC, CGS, ISPRA, GEUS, GEOZS, RBINS).

Support to data providers to help them implement the guidance provided by the cookbooks and e-Learning resources will take the form of a number of activities including:
- A buddy system and mentoring network that provides support from experienced organisations who have existing expertise in making data available following interoperable standards.
- An email help desk function providing a triage system to ensure users are put in contact with members of the GIP team who are best placed to help with any specific request.
- provision of training workshops with the purpose of further promoting the creation of data web services for inclusion in the GIP. These will take the form of webinars to reduce travel. Two such webinars are envisaged. There is the potential to consider one of these webinars to be conducted as face-to-face workshop to coincide with one of the coordination meetings.

This work will commence in the Prototyping phase, continue in to the Full Development phase with finalisation being carried out in the Wrap-up phase.
