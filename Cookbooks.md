# Cookbooks

## Task 8.1. Write a series of cookbooks to assist data providers in the utilisation of available standards to share GSP generated data. (NERC, ISPRA, GEUS, GEOZS, CGS, RBINS, GeoInform, NGU, HGI-CGS)

A cookbook can be considered a best practice manual 'containing a straightforward set of already tried and tested recipes or instructions for a specific activity'.

Building on the work done within OneGeology, this work package will provide a series of 'cookbooks' giving best practice on remodelling data to common agreed target schemas as identified in WP3 and using software to provide data in accordance with GIP standards e.g. on how to configure a WFS using GeoSciML from an institutions' internal digital databases. Such cookbooks will provide documented worked examples with workflows and sample code on how to deliver data to the GIP using commonly used industry software (both open source and proprietary as appropriate). Importantly, cookbooks will also be provided relating to the provision of metadata and metadata services as deemed necessary by the architecture of the GIP. They will also make the work of WP4 accessible to GeoERA data providers by supporting them in structuring their data so as to enhance semantic harmonisation across the GIP. These documents will provide specific work-flow guidance notes to enable full participation regardless of an organisationâ€™s expertise.

This work will commence within the Prototyping phase and continue into the Full Development phase with finalisation being carried out in the Wrap-up phase. It is anticipated that most GSPs will add their data to the GIP towards the end of the Full Development phase and in the Wrap-up phase. The data support resources need to be available at that point though initial versions will be provided to encourage data providers to make early attempts at delivering via the GIP.

## Deliverables

D8.1 A series of cookbooks (documents in PDF format or similar) assisting data providers delivering data to the GIP [released iteratively with final version month 32]
